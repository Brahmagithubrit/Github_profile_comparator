#  GitHub Developer Profile Comparator

**GitHub Developer Profile Comparator** is a tool that uses the **GitHub API** to compare developer profiles based on key metrics like language usage, repository activity, followers, stars, and more. It helps users understand how two or more GitHub profiles stack up against each other — whether for learning, collaboration, or competition.

##  What It Does

-  Fetches live profile data from GitHub using a personal access token
-  Compares multiple devs based on:
  - Most used programming languages
  - Number of repositories
  - Stars, forks, and watchers
  - Followers/following ratio
  - Contribution and activity overview
-  Visual output to show which developer is ahead in what category
