# 🚀 Request for Contribution: React Frontend Development for GitHub Profile Comparison Tool

## 📋 Project Overview

The GitHub Profile Comparison Tool is designed to allow users to compare two GitHub profiles. It fetches data from the GitHub API and provides detailed insights into the profiles being compared, including repository counts, primary languages, followers, and contributions. This tool is a valuable resource for understanding profile statistics and identifying areas for improvement.

## 🛠 Backend Details

The backend for this project has been implemented using:

- Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic.
- Axios for making API requests to the GitHub API.
- dotenv for managing environment variables.

### 🔄 Backend Routes

The following backend routes are available:

1. GET `/`
   - Serves an HTML form for users to input two GitHub profile names.

2. POST `/compare`
   - Accepts two profile names (`name` and `comparator`) and responds with:
     - A comparison table of profile statistics.
     - Feedback for improving the user’s GitHub profile based on the comparison.

## 🌐 Backend URL

The backend is hosted at: [https://rb.gy/xj0hfo](https://rb.gy/xj0hfo)
